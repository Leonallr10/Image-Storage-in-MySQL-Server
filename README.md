# Image Storage in MySQL Server

## Overview
This project aims to store images in a MySQL server and retrieve the data using Node.js and Express.js with the help of `express-fileupload` middleware. The uploaded images are stored in a folder named `"public/images/upload_images/"`. The application runs on `localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Bootstrap
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- `express-fileupload` middleware

## Folder Structure
- **public/images/upload_images/**: Folder used to store uploaded images from the frontend.

## How it Works
1. The frontend sends an image file to the backend server.
2. The Node.js server handles the file upload using Express.js and `express-fileupload`.
3. The uploaded image is stored in the specified folder on the server.
4. The image valid only image format only
5. Metadata about the image (e.g., file name, path) is stored in the MySQL database.
6. Users can retrieve the images from the server through the frontend.

## EJS Templating Engine
EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is utilized as the templating engine for rendering HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It simplifies the process of rendering dynamic content on web pages by using placeholders in HTML templates, which are replaced with dynamic content generated by JavaScript code. EJS is commonly used with Node.js to create scalable and high-performance web applications.

EJS supports both server-side and client-side rendering, providing flexibility in choosing the rendering approach based on project requirements.

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `npm start`.
4. Access the application via `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

This project provides a seamless solution for storing and retrieving images in a MySQL database, enhancing the functionality of web applications that require image handling capabilities.
